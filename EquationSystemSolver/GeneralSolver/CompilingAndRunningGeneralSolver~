TCcalc is a general linear equation system solver, that can solve systems where the variables can be negative and non-integers. It can also detect whether the system is  solvable or not. It works similar to matlabs x = A\b

Compile the source files with the following commands:

g++ TCcalc.cpp -std=c++0x -o TCcalc
g++ TCgen.cpp -o TCgen
g++ TCcheck.cpp -std=c++0x -o TCcheck

Run with the following commands:

./TCgen eq 

Generates an equation system, stored in the file eq, with the answers stored in ans.

./TCcalc eq

Solves the equation system stored in eq and prints the answers to stdout

./TCcalc eq | ./TCcheck eq

Solves the equation system and pipes the answers to TCcheck, which controls their correctnesss by checking the output of the solver against the lines in the ans file. If there is a string missmatch, an error message will be printed. If everything is correct, nothing will be printed.

For testing: 

Compile 
- TCcalc.cpp
- TCcheck.cpp
- TCgen.cpp

Run:

- test.sh

The shell-scripts run 1000 randomly generated equation systems, and compare the output of TCcalc against the system. If there is a mismatch between the strings, the loop breaks and an error message prints. If everything goes well, nothing will print
